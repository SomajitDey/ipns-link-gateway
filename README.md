# IPNS-Link-gateway

[![PR](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-Accepted-green)](https://github.com/ipns-link/ipns-link-gateway/pulls) ![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-GNU%2fLinux-blue.svg) ![Lang](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lang-Bash-cyan.svg) ![UI](https://img.shields.io/badge/UI-Command%20line-orange.svg)

Prototype implementation of [IPNS-Link-gateway](https://github.com/ipns-link/specs).

This implementation doesn't support HTTP/2. It prefers HTTP/1.1 but can't support persistent connections. To enable HTTP2 and persistent connections, simply put a capable reverse-proxy in front. If you choose to use [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), which helps with automatic HTTPS too, this project repository contains a ready [Caddyfile](/Caddyfile).

#####   

### Self-hosting

1. Download: 

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ipns-link/ipns-link-gateway
   ```

2. Go to the downloaded git-repo:

   ```bash
   cd ipns-link-gateway
   ```

3. Launch: 

   ```bash
   ./ipns-link-gateway -a "AnyAlphanumericPassword"
   ```

4. Note the PID shown. To stop the server later just do `kill "PID"`

5. Open http://www.localhost:8080 at any browser

##### Customize

See available command-line options with: 

```bash
./ipns-link-gateway -h
```

### Cloud-hosting

Suppose your gateway is to have the URL: `https://domain.tld`. So, first of all, purchase the domain and familiarize yourself with the DNS manager console of your domain registrar / DNS provider. Create and store an API token for your DNS provider.

##### Heroku

![Pricing](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pricing-Free--Tier-brightgreen) 

1. [Verify account](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/account-verification)
2. [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy) 
3. [Edit config_var to](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#using-the-heroku-dashboard) : `URL: https://domain.tld` and `Password: AnyAlphanumericString`
4. [Add wild-card domain](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains): `*.domain.tld`
5. [Manage SSL](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl) or [use Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205893698-Configure-Cloudflare-and-Heroku-over-HTTPS)

##### EC2 (AWS)

![Pricing](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pricing-Free--Tier-brightgreen) 

The following uses EC2 which is free for 1 year only with 750 hours/month. If you are stuck following any instruction below, or need further details, refer to the [EC2 UserGuide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html).

**Aim**: The goal is to run the gateway at EC2, as a backend/upstream of a [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) reverse-proxy. Caddy would take care of HTTPS and everything else a modern server needs. If you don't know what all these mean, fear not. Just follow the steps below.

1. [Sign up](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).

2. [Go to Services and then EC2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

3. [Select the region you want to run the Gateway in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/select-region.html).

4. [Create your key-pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair). [Download the key file and change permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connection-prereqs.html#connection-prereqs-private-key).

5. Choose "Launch an instance".

6. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) : The Free-tier-eligible Ubuntu 20.04 amd64.

7. Choose an Instance Type : The Free-tier-eligible t2.micro.

8. On the "Choose an Instance Type" page, choose "Review and Launch" to let the wizard complete the other configuration settings for you.

9. On the "Review Instance Launch" page, under "Security Groups", you'll see that the wizard created and selected a security group for you. Edit the inbound-rules to contain: 

   | Protocol | Port | IP                            |
   | -------- | ---- | ----------------------------- |
   | SSH      | 22   | Choose as appropriate for you |
   | HTTP     | 80   | 0.0.0.0/0                     |
   | HTTPS    | 443  | 0.0.0.0/0                     |

10. Choose "Launch".

11. When prompted for a key pair, select "Choose an existing key pair", then select the key pair that you created when getting set up. When you are ready, select the acknowledgement check box, and then choose "Launch Instances".

12. [Get the static public IPv4 address or public DNS name of the instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connection-prereqs.html).

13. Leaving the instance to launch, head over to your DNS provider and add to/edit your DNS records as follows:

    | Type  | Name   | Points to                           |
    | ----- | ------ | ----------------------------------- |
    | A     | @      | Static public IPv4 of your instance |
    | CNAME | www    | @                                   |
    | CNAME | ipns   | @                                   |
    | CNAME | ipfs   | @                                   |
    | CNAME | *.ipns | @                                   |
    | CNAME | *.ipfs | @                                   |

    **NOTE**: Restarting your EC2 instance doesn't change the public IP address. But everything else, such as starting/stopping or terminating and creating a new instance, does. Whenever you do such things that change the IP, simply update the IP in your DNS records.

14. Locate the private key you downloaded earlier and SSH to your instance as 

    ```bash
    ssh -i your-private-key-file ubuntu@www.domain.tld
    ```

15. Download the project repo and **move into it** 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ipns-link/ipns-link-gateway; cd ipns-link-gateway
    ```

16. Install the dependencies. The Heroku buildpack can actually help you here ðŸ˜‰

    ```bash
    bin/compile
    ```

17. Install [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/download) for Linux amd64, custom built with your DNS provider's plugin. For example's sake, we assume your DNS provider is CloudFlare.

18. **Change to root**

    ```bash
    sudo su root
    ```

19. Launch the Gateway

    ```bash
    ./ipns-link-gateway -a "AlphanumericPassword" "https://domain.tld"
    ```

    Wait for the prompt to return.

20. Note the PID shown. To stop the server later you can simply execute: `sudo kill "PID"`.

21. **Set the environment** 

    ```bash
    export DOMAIN="gateway.tld" DNS_PROV="cloudflare" API_TKN="Your-API-Token"
    ```

22. Start Caddy

    ```bash
    caddy start
    ```

    To stop `caddy` later you just have to execute: `caddy stop`.

23. Caddy requests, installs and manages all the required SSL certificates on its own. The certificates are issued for free by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/) and [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com/). The Gateway can now be availed at https://www.domain.tld.

24. To update and restart the gateway and caddy periodically, and on reboot, create a [Cron job](https://opensource.com/article/17/11/how-use-cron-linux). You may use the crontab [file](/crontab) from this repo, after editing it as instructed therein. It logs in a `cron.log` file within this repo. Caddy logs in `caddy.log`.

25. Create a free uptime monitor with say [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to get notified whenever your server goes down.
